# Streaming Matrix Sketching

This repository contains a single Jupyter notebook implementing and comparing three popular matrix sketching / dimensionality reduction techniques on streaming data:

- **Frequent Directions (FD)**
- **Incremental PCA (IPCA)**
- **Gaussian Random Projection (GRP)**

The dataset used in these experiments can be accessed from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)
